# Homework11-Note-Taker
In this project, we are making a note taker that takes an input and saves it for the user. The note is saved in a database to look at and retrieve later.

# Why
With an ever busy work life, keeping track of things gets hard. With this note taker, we are hoping to help those busy people stay more organized and productive.

# The Process
We started with a basic CSS and HTML template mostly using Bootstrap for style. Then we grabbed the JavaScript for functionality. We then made a server.js, downloading all the dependancies we needed like Express and UUID. Within server.js we needed to get the server to store and retrieve notes stored. When we got everything functional, we uploaded to heroku for the application launch.
